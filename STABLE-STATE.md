# Stable Working State - v1.0.2

## Date: January 27, 2025

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING

### What's Working:
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured (not being overwritten)
- ✅ DigitalOcean API authentication working
- ✅ Current agent loading successfully
- ✅ Passkey authentication configured
- ✅ Cloudant database connection working
- ✅ Frontend-backend communication working
- ✅ App deployed and running on DigitalOcean App Platform
- ✅ Build process fixed - completely removed PDF parsing functionality

### Key Fixes Applied:
1. **Environment Variables Fixed**: Removed all env vars from `app.yaml` to prevent overwriting during deployments
2. **WebAuthn Configuration**: Fixed `rpID` to use exact domain `maia-cloud-clean-kjho4.ondigitalocean.app`
3. **API Keys Restored**: All API keys properly set via DigitalOcean Bulk Editor
4. **Database Connection**: Cloudant credentials working correctly
5. **PDF Parsing Issue Resolved**: Completely removed PDF parsing functionality from both frontend and backend

### Current Configuration:
- **App URL**: https://maia-cloud-clean-kjho4.ondigitalocean.app
- **Region**: Toronto (tor1)
- **Environment Variables**: Managed via DigitalOcean dashboard (not in `app.yaml`)
- **Git Tag**: `v1.0.2-stable`
- **Backup Branch**: `backup/stable-working-version`

### Environment Variables (Set in DigitalOcean Dashboard):
All environment variables are properly configured in the DigitalOcean App Platform dashboard via Bulk Editor. The configuration includes:

- **API Keys**: DigitalOcean, Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini
- **Database**: Cloudant/CouchDB credentials
- **App Configuration**: Port, origins, logging, etc.
- **Authentication**: Passkey configuration

*Note: Actual API keys and credentials are stored securely in DigitalOcean dashboard, not in this repository.*

### How to Restore This State:
1. **Git Tag**: `git checkout v1.0.2-stable`
2. **Backup Branch**: `git checkout backup/stable-working-version`
3. **Environment Variables**: Use the Bulk Editor in DigitalOcean dashboard

### Next Steps:
- Continue with passkey authentication testing
- Test all major functionality
- Document any remaining issues
- Re-enable PDF parsing with proper Node.js-compatible library when needed (currently completely removed)
