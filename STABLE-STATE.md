# Stable Working State - v1.0.4

## Date: August 4, 2025

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING - Knowledge Base Protection Milestone

### What's Working:
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured (not being overwritten)
- ✅ DigitalOcean API authentication working
- ✅ Current agent loading successfully
- ✅ Passkey authentication configured and working
- ✅ Cloudant database connection working
- ✅ Frontend-backend communication working
- ✅ App deployed and running on DigitalOcean App Platform
- ✅ Build process fixed - completely removed PDF parsing functionality
- ✅ **KNOWLEDGE BASE PROTECTION SYSTEM WORKING** - Users can now authenticate and attach their own protected knowledge bases
- ✅ **Authentication Flow Complete** - Passkey authentication properly integrated with KB protection
- ✅ **UI Components Fixed** - Attach/detach icons working, currentUser state properly managed

### Key Fixes Applied:
1. **Environment Variables Fixed**: Removed all env vars from `app.yaml` to prevent overwriting during deployments
2. **WebAuthn Configuration**: Fixed `rpID` to use exact domain `maia-cloud-clean-kjho4.ondigitalocean.app`
3. **API Keys Restored**: All API keys properly set via DigitalOcean Bulk Editor
4. **Database Connection**: Cloudant credentials working correctly
5. **PDF Parsing Issue Resolved**: Completely removed PDF parsing functionality from both frontend and backend
6. **KB Protection System Fixed**: Added userId to knowledge base attachment requests to enable proper access control
7. **Authentication Integration**: Fixed user ID field mapping (`userId` vs `username`) in AgentManagementDialog
8. **Vue 3 Composition API Fixes**: Fixed props access in templates and setup functions
9. **Current User State Management**: Properly implemented computed properties for currentUser prop access

### Current Configuration:
- **App URL**: https://maia-cloud-clean-kjho4.ondigitalocean.app
- **Region**: Toronto (tor1)
- **Environment Variables**: Managed via DigitalOcean dashboard (not in `app.yaml`)
- **Git Tag**: `v1.0.4-stable` (to be created)
- **Backup Branch**: `backup/stable-working-version`

### Knowledge Base Protection Features:
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Passkey-based authentication working
- ✅ **KB Ownership**: Users can only access their own protected knowledge bases
- ✅ **Access Control**: Server-side validation of user permissions
- ✅ **UI Integration**: Proper authentication flow in AgentManagementDialog
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper 401/403 error responses for unauthorized access
- ✅ **State Management**: Current user state properly maintained across components

### Environment Variables (Set in DigitalOcean Dashboard):
All environment variables are properly configured in the DigitalOcean App Platform dashboard via Bulk Editor. The configuration includes:

- **API Keys**: DigitalOcean, Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini
- **Database**: Cloudant/CouchDB credentials
- **App Configuration**: Port, origins, logging, etc.
- **Authentication**: Passkey configuration

*Note: Actual API keys and credentials are stored securely in DigitalOcean dashboard, not in this repository.*

### How to Restore This State:
1. **Git Tag**: `git checkout v1.0.4-stable` (to be created)
2. **Backup Branch**: `git checkout backup/stable-working-version`
3. **Environment Variables**: Use the Bulk Editor in DigitalOcean dashboard

### Technical Achievements:
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: Properly implemented computed properties for prop access
- **Authentication Flow**: Complete passkey authentication with proper user state management
- **Knowledge Base Protection**: Server-side access control with user ownership validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for authentication and authorization
- **UI State Management**: Proper reactive state management for current user

### Next Steps:
- Test knowledge base protection with multiple users
- Add additional security features if needed
- Document the knowledge base protection system
- Consider adding audit logging for KB access
- Re-enable PDF parsing with proper Node.js-compatible library when needed (currently completely removed)
