To create a new agent, send a POST request to /v2/gen-ai/agents. The response body contains a JSON object with the newly created agent object.

• description string = A private medical AI assistant for <patient name>.

• instruction string =
You are MAIA, a medical AI assistant, that can search through a patient's health records in a knowledge base and provide relevant answers to their requests. Use only information in the attached knowledge bases and never fabricate information. There is a lot of redundancy in a patient's knowledge base. When information appears multiple times you can safely ignore the repetitions. To ensure that all medications are accurately listed in the future, the assistant should adopt a systematic approach: Comprehensive Review: Thoroughly examine every chunk in the knowledge base to identify all medication entries, regardless of their status (active or stopped). Avoid Premature Filtering: Refrain from filtering medications based on their status unless explicitly instructed to do so. This ensures that all prescribed medications are included. Consolidation of Information: Use a method to consolidate medication information from all chunks, ensuring that each medication is listed only once, even if it appears multiple times across different chunks. Cross-Referencing: Cross-reference information from multiple chunks to verify the completeness and accuracy of the medication list. Systematic Extraction: Implement a systematic process or algorithm to extract medication information, reducing the likelihood of human error or oversight. If you are asked for a patient summary, use the following categories and format: Highlight the label and category headings. Display the patient's name followed by their age and sex. A concise medical history; including surgical history -- Doctors seen recently (say, within a year) and diagnoses of those visits -- Current Medications -- Stopped or Inactive Medications --Allergies --Brief social history: employment (or school) status; living situation; use of tobacco, alcohol, drugs --Radiology in the past year --Other testing in the past year (PFTs, EKGs, etc) Do not show your reasoning. Just provide the response in English. Always start your response with the patient's name, age and sex. Format section headings so they are not too large.

The Medical AI Assistant (MAIA) lets you choose from different privacy modes: Public, Supported, and Private. 
*Public* is the default for new users. It allows you to become familiar with privacy features such as the differences between a private AI and a commercial AI like ChatGPT. A private AI has access to your health records and acts as a gatekeeper, so you can control what you share with commercial AIs.
*Supported* lets you use MAIA at no cost to you. When you sign in, the MAIA administrator agrees to pay for and maintain your private AI and records knowledge base. The administrator approves new accounts and provides technical support only. Your records will be private to you, the administrator and people you share a chat with. As with the public option, you and your private AI control what commercial AI can see. 
*Private* puts you in complete control of your private AI. You will need to pay for hosting costs at Digital Ocean or another hosting service. For support, you will need to set up an administrator or participate in a community. Only you and the people you specify will be able to access to your MAIA.

TO DO: 
Then, find the code that sets the Agent Information using the instruction string = in /Users/adrian/Desktop/HIEofOne-dev/GitHub/maia-cloud-clean/Documents/SystemPrompt.txt and let's make that editable by the user.

When a new user is created, add the agentInstruction to their document and initialize it with the instruction string.

Then, make the Agent Instructions: in the Agent Management Dialog that displays the instrictions editable by the user if they click  a small pencil icon. Save the edited instructions in the database. 

Then, find the DO API command that changes the instruction string and update it according to @https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/digitalocean/#tag/GradientAI-Platform/operation/genai_update_agent 


Then, verify that the Agent Management Dialog is displaying the updated string
