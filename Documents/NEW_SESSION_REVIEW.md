Here are some of them:
- Signing out left the user session status in disarray
- Signing in also left the user session messed up
- Reloading the page left the user session in disarray
- The Agent Management Dialog is often inaccurate for new users like "ag30"
- A bucket folder was not created for "ag30" 
- ag30 has a passkey but is failing authentication
- The user session state is hard to track and is not adequately displayed on the Agent Management Dialog
- SSE doesn't work in the cloud so we need a polling strategy for users and admins to follow the new user process and other changes to the DO API.
- There is not enough self-testing and validation for actions that involve the DO API.
